# Journal View test vault

Throwaway vault for exercising the plugin by hand. Gitignored, so anything written
here stays local. Rebuild it any time with `npm run test-vault` from the repository
root; files that already exist are kept.

`.obsidian/plugins/journal-view` links to the repository root, so the vault loads
whatever `npm run build` last produced.

Daily notes resolve to folder `Journal`, format `YYYY-MM-DD`, template
`Templates/Daily`. Journal View's own overrides are left empty, so those vault
settings are what it inherits.

## Opening it

Obsidian has to know the vault before the URL scheme will open it. The first time,
add it through the vault switcher (bottom left) -> Manage vaults -> Open folder as
vault, and pick `test-vault`. After that:

```bash
open "obsidian://open?vault=test-vault"
```

## Driving it from the terminal

The `obsidian` CLI reaches the vault by name, which beats clicking for anything
repeatable:

```bash
obsidian vault=test-vault command id=journal-view:open
```

`eval` runs JavaScript inside the vault's window, so a day can be inspected
directly:

```bash
obsidian vault=test-vault eval code='const v=app.workspace.getLeavesOfType("journal-view")[0].view; const s=v.sections.find(x=>x.offset===0); s.editor.focus(); s.editor.getValue()'
```

Two things will waste your afternoon if you do not know them:

- **Obsidian must believe it has focus.** Chromium does not dispatch focus events
  while `document.hasFocus()` is false, so anything driven from the terminal with
  the window in the background silently skips every focus path - which reads
  exactly like the feature being broken. Turn focus emulation on first, and off
  when you are done:

  ```bash
  obsidian vault=test-vault dev:debug on && obsidian vault=test-vault dev:cdp method=Emulation.setFocusEmulationEnabled params='{"enabled":true}'
  ```

- **Plugins are not hot-reloaded.** After `npm run build` the running window still
  has the old code:

  ```bash
  obsidian vault=test-vault eval code='(async()=>{await app.plugins.disablePlugin("journal-view"); await app.plugins.enablePlugin("journal-view"); return "reloaded"})()'
  ```

Useful while debugging: `dev:errors` (unhandled rejections land here), `dev:console`,
`dev:dom selector=...`, and `dev:cdp method=Input.insertText params='{"text":"..."}'`
to type into whatever holds focus.

## Testing on iOS

Desktop mobile emulation still runs Chromium, so use a physical iPhone or iPad
for WebKit, touch and momentum-scrolling issues. This command builds the plugin,
copies this test vault into Obsidian's iCloud container as `Journal View Test`,
installs real plugin files instead of the repository symlink, and adds Journal
View to the vault's enabled community plugins:

```bash
npm run deploy:ios
```

The default destination is:

```text
~/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/Journal View Test
```

If the iCloud container is elsewhere, pass the absolute vault path directly or
set `JOURNAL_VIEW_IOS_VAULT`:

```bash
npm run deploy:ios -- "/absolute/path/to/Journal View Test"
JOURNAL_VIEW_IOS_VAULT="/absolute/path/to/Journal View Test" npm run deploy:ios
```

Deploying again updates the build and matching test-vault files without deleting
files created only on iOS. It also preserves the iOS workspace and any other
enabled community plugins. Wait for iCloud to finish syncing, then restart
Obsidian or toggle Journal View off and on to load the new build.

For Safari Web Inspector, enable **Settings -> Apps -> Safari -> Advanced -> Web
Inspector** on iOS. Enable developer features in Safari on the Mac, connect the
device, open this vault, and select Obsidian under **Develop -> [device]**.

## Checks worth running

1. **Type in an empty day.** The day fills with the template body on focus; type,
   then read the note. It should have the template's frontmatter with `date` and
   `weekday` filled in for that day, above what you typed.
2. **Enter an empty day and leave without typing.** The template appears, then goes
   away on blur, and no file is created under `Journal/`.
3. **"Create note" button.** Same note as (1).
4. **A day that already has a note.** No template offered; content untouched.
5. **A template that cannot be read.** Point `daily-notes.json` at a missing file:
   the day stays empty, a warning is logged, and `dev:errors` stays clean.

## Resetting

```bash
git clean -xfd test-vault   # or just delete the notes the checks created
npm run test-vault
```
