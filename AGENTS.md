# Journal View contributor guide

Journal View is an Obsidian plugin that presents daily notes as one continuous,
editable timeline. See [README.md](README.md) for behavior and installation.

## Development

- Use TypeScript and Obsidian APIs; keep UI styling in `styles.css`.
- Run `npm run typecheck` while developing and `npm run build` before handing
  off changes. The build output, `main.js`, is intentionally ignored.
- Preserve user content: flush pending edits during teardown and handle vault
  writes, renames, and concurrent file creation defensively.
- Obsidian's embedded Markdown editor is an internal API. Keep access isolated
  in `src/editor.ts`, guard failures, and retain the plain-text fallback.

## Change workflow

- Use `dev` as the integration branch. Start every feature or fix branch from
  the latest `dev`, and keep unrelated changes on separate branches so each
  change can be reviewed and reverted independently.
- Open feature and fix pull requests into `dev`. Do not merge them directly into
  `main`, and do not commit features or fixes directly to either shared branch.
- Keep `main` release-only. Move changes from `dev` to `main` through one release
  pull request that also contains the version bump; do not create a separate
  version-only release branch or pull request.
- Keep pull requests focused, describe the user-visible effect, and include the
  verification that was actually performed.

## Testing

Run `npm test` for deterministic save, conflict, lifecycle, and index regression
checks. These exercise actual TypeScript methods with mocked vault APIs and timers;
they do not emulate Obsidian's editor or DOM. Also verify interaction changes in the
throwaway vault instead of a real one, and say what you actually exercised.

```bash
npm run test-vault   # builds/repairs test-vault/, gitignored, plugin symlinked in
```

Add it in Obsidian once (vault switcher -> Manage vaults -> Open folder as vault),
after which the `obsidian` CLI can drive it without any clicking:

```bash
obsidian vault=test-vault command id=journal-view:open
obsidian vault=test-vault eval code='app.workspace.getLeavesOfType("journal-view")[0].view.sections.length'
```

Two traps, both of which look exactly like the feature being broken:

- **Focus events need a focused document.** Chromium will not dispatch them while
  `document.hasFocus()` is false, so anything driven from the terminal with the
  window in the background skips every focus path. Enable focus emulation first
  (`dev:debug on`, then `Emulation.setFocusEmulationEnabled`) and disable it after.
- **Plugins are not hot-reloaded.** `npm run build` does not touch the running
  window; disable and re-enable the plugin to pick the new code up.

`test-vault/README-TESTING.md` has the full recipes and the checks worth running.

## Code map

- `src/main.ts`: plugin lifecycle, commands, and view registration
- `src/view.ts` / `src/day.ts`: timeline virtualization and per-day UI
- `src/dailyNotes.ts` / `src/noteIndex.ts`: note resolution and indexing
- `src/editor.ts` / `src/saveQueue.ts`: editing and durable writes

The view delegates to four collaborators, each holding the view through a small
host interface it implements:

- `src/anchor.ts`: pins the reader's place and spends the top spacer on drift
- `src/editorWindow.ts`: picks which days are live editors, and guards the
  scroll position while one is mounted
- `src/dayWalk.ts`: day offsets, dates and index keys, including hidden days
- `src/toolbar.ts`: the toolbar strip

Pure scroll geometry lives separately in `src/scroll.ts`.

`src/datePicker.ts` is the toolbar's calendar: a scrolling column of months that
hangs off the view rather than being part of it, and moves the journal by date.

## Preparing a release

When the user asks to prepare a release:

- Confirm the intended semantic version; do not guess the release version when
  the user has not specified it.
- Make sure `dev` is clean, up to date with `origin/dev`, and contains all and
  only the feature and fix pull requests intended for the release. Prepare the
  release on `dev`, not on a feature branch or `main`.
- On `dev`, update all version files with
  `npm version <version> --no-git-tag-version`. Run `npm run typecheck` and
  `npm run build`, then commit and push the version bump to `dev`.
- Open one pull request from `dev` into `main`. That release pull request must
  contain both the accumulated user-visible changes and their version bump.
  Describe the changes and include only verification that was actually
  performed. Do not open a separate version-only pull request.
- Do not tag the head of `dev` or an unmerged release pull request. Leave the
  pull request for review, and do not merge it unless the user explicitly asks.
- After the release pull request is merged, update local `main`, verify that
  `manifest.json` has the intended version, and create an annotated tag on the
  merged `main` commit with
  `git tag -a <version> -m "Release <version>"`, then push it with
  `git push origin <version>`. The tag must be the exact version from
  `manifest.json`, without a `v` prefix; pushing it triggers the GitHub Action
  that builds the plugin and creates the draft GitHub release.
- Verify that the tag push succeeded and report whether the release workflow was
  triggered. Do not publish the draft release unless the user explicitly asks.
- Provide copy-ready release notes based on user-visible changes since the
  previous tag. Put new features before fixes, use bullet points, and omit an
  empty section:

  ```markdown
  ## New features

  - Added ...

  ## Fixes

  - Fixed ...
  ```
